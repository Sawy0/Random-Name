# We_Rate_Dogs_Analysis_Project
## I pulled 2.3K tweets from Twitter posted by a page called WeRateDogs. This page rates people's dogs in a funny way and it serves a hilarous content.
## I wanted know what insights could've come up from running an analysis over these tweets, so I ran a data wranling process where I assessed the data I gathered and cleaned it.
## Later on, I used a profile provided by Udacity which was an outcome of a neural network to identify the dogs' breeds by photos and ran the analysis over the data I wrangled.
## Check the file in the repo to see the analysis :D
